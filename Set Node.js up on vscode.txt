To run javascript with vscode first you need to install node.js on (wsl / windows).
	if you install it on wsl you can run it just by open terminal "ubuntu/any distro" then type "node filename.js".

	if you install it on windows you can run it by terminal "pc/powershell" then type "node filename.js".
	but you can easly run it with extension "code runner".then klik run button on right top.

- Install node.js use NVM which you can easily install and manage multiple node.js using i terminal (like in linux/wsl)
The different between install it manually and using NVM is when you install manual by visit the node.js web 
you just install it like another program installation but when you wanna update it you should uninstall the
previos version then install it manually again.

But when you use NVM you can easily intall it just by command and when you wat to update it you can do it just
by command (multiple install).
